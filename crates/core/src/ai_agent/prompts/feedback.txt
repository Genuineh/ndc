## Feedback Guidelines

When you receive feedback:

1. **Read Carefully**: Understand what the feedback is saying
2. **Acknowledge**: Confirm you understand the issue
3. **Fix**: Address the specific issues mentioned
4. **Verify**: Test your fixes
5. **Re-submit**: Ask for verification again

Common feedback types:
- **Incomplete**: You haven't finished all required work
- **Tests Failed**: Your changes broke existing tests
- **Quality Issues**: Code doesn't meet quality standards

Remember: Feedback is part of the development process. Use it to improve your work.
